## Summary

I plan to Build a "SMART MIRROR". In our daily routines, we often visit multiple applications. One enthusiast solution to combine these applications is the smart mirror -- a mirror that serves a reflection and displays information. There exists a
community that develops features for smart mirrors -- for example: to-do lists, stock viewers, and even video browsers. We saw room to solve two problems. First, we saw that consistently recording 1-second-a-day videos can be difficult. Second, 
we saw that gamers wanted to stay updated on changes to game. Thus, we decided to leverage this platform to add two modules -- a 1-second-a-day module and a game patch notes module. Respectively, these would make it easier for people to build their 
own 1-second-a-day videos and stay current on game updates.

## Plan
---Technologies

In this project it can be broken down into three major parts:
1. Smart Mirror construction
2. 1-second-a-day module development
3. Patch notes module development

* *Smart Mirror Construction* * <br>
smart mirror consists of five main components:
1. A Monitor
2. A Computer
3. A Webcam
4. A Two-way mirror
5. A Frame
<br>
* *Frame Building Process* 

Before building mirror, I had to give careful attention in researching and choosing the parts. Many
options for components can conflict with other components due to physical or software constraints

* *Monitor* * <br>
I chose the LED monitor for multiple reasons. First, the monitor was 24" wide diagonally.
This was large enough for a person to see most of their upper body in their reflection but small enough so
our two-way mirror didn't have to be sized at an inordinately expensive size. Second, the bezel of the
monitor was removable via a flathead screwdriver. This allows us to arrange the monitor's display flush
against the two-way mirror, resulting in a sharper image
<br>

* *Rasberry Pie* * <br>
The Raspberry Pi is a compact computer popular in many home internet-of-things projects. I chose
the Raspberry Pi because of its small size and low cost.
<br>

* *Two-way Mirror* * <br>
A smart mirror's mirror can be made of reflective film, glass, or acrylic. I decided to go with a ready-cut
two-way mirrored acrylic from TapPlastics. Acrylic is superior to film, in that it allows more light from the
monitor to shine through. At the same time, it is cheaper and less fragile than glass.
<br>

* *Frame: Glacier Bay 15 1/4in x 26in Medicine Cabinet* * <br>
I choose the medicine cabinet as model frame. First, its mirror opening is the perfect size -- only slightly
larger than my LED monitor. Second, its hollow body provides just enough room to store the monitor.
Third, its built-in hinge allows us to easily open up the smart mirror and access/adjust its internal
components

Just want to clarify that these websites I'll be using to buy the material.
