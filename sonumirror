## Summary

I plan to Build a "SMART MIRROR". In our daily routines, we often visit multiple applications. One enthusiast solution to combine these applications is the smart mirror -- a mirror that serves a reflection and displays information. There exists a
community that develops features for smart mirrors -- for example: to-do lists, stock viewers, and even video browsers. We saw room to solve two problems. First, we saw that consistently recording
1-second-a-day videos can be difficult. Second, we saw that gamers wanted to stay updated on changes to game. Thus, we decided to leverage this platform to add two modules -- a 1-second-a-day module and
a game patch notes module. Respectively, these would make it easier for people to build their own 1-second-a-day videos and stay current on game updates.

## Plan
---Technologies

In this project it can be broken down into three major parts:
1. Smart Mirror construction
2. 1-second-a-day module development
3. Patch notes module development


Just want to clarify that these websites I'll be using to buy the material.
